## 📝 How it works

[(Back to top)](#📌-table-of-contents)

Bakend is a baking ingredients converter app. Turned vegan? Or lactose intolerant? Or maybe just forgot to buy milk? Or just happy to experiment and give a personal twist to your cake recipes?

There is a calculator page for each of the basic baking ingredients, such as butter, sugar and milk.

Just type how much butter, sugar or milk you need according to your recipe and choose among the available options your favourite substitute. Bakend will do the maths for you!

The result you get is calculated using the exchange rate of each ingredient.

Would you like to know more of each ingredient stored in the database? Just visit the "Explore" page of the app. There you can type the name of the ingredient you are interested in. You will get the all the results from the directly from database. For each ingredient stored in the database there are nutrition facts and allergies warnings listed.
(The app is for entertainment purposes only and never replaces a physician's advice.
Please check the label of each product before you purchase it.)
